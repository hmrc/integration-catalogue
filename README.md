## Goals

This is the backend service for the integration-catalogue-frontend and the integration-catalogue-admin-frontend.

It stores API and File Transfer data specific to HMRC.

All the data is stored in the backend in a standard MDTP MongoDB. No customer or PII data is be used or stored in the catalogue. The API Catalogue is not a system of record for API meta-data and could be repopulated if required from the platform teams.
